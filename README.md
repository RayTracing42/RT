# RayTracer project for 42

## Build instructions:

* mac: just `make` and it works
* linux: install the SDL2 library then `make debug-linux`
* windows: install a linux distribution on your computer.

## Usage:

./rt [path/to/the/map.xml] [number_of_threads]

For a quad core processor 128 threads seems to be the fastest.
All the pretty maps are in the folder "scenes", and all the tests maps are in the folder "tests" and its sub-folders.

Press A to launch the AntiAliasing (SSAAX16), press S to take a screenshot.
